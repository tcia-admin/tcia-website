In this session, we will share our experiences as we developed and delivered this as an education studies class in the spring of 2025.  In the class, we examined how “carcerality” is an organizing feature of public education in the U.S. by exploring disciplinary processes, technology, and surveillance practices, curricular norms, and the built environment in schools, as well as attempts to challenge such carceral logics, especially through organized efforts of communities of color. ",

While the evidence of the value of edtech to contemporary learning is exaggerated, many very real harms related to surveillance abuse have been underreported. Based on the work of community organizers active in anti-surveillance and youth movements, I propose a few questions schools, parents, and education professionals of all kinds might ask before incorporating edtech into classroom learning.",
